# quickstart-mcafee-epo
## McAfee ePO on the AWS Cloud

This Quick Start sets up a highly available, secure AWS environment, and launches McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator (ePO) Security Management Platform that integrates with Amazon Web Services(AWS) such as Amazon Managed Relational Database Service(RDS), Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and Amazon CloudWatch.

Use this quick start to deploy McAfee ePO to manage from a single console endpoint security, data loss prevention, encryption, public cloud server (your AWS environment), and the innovative information sharing Data Exchange Layer (DXL)

Simplify. Accelerate. Orchestrate. This security management platform allows you to handle a comprehensive threat defense lifecycle so you can protect, detect & correct from a common view across your IT environment. Gain global, contextual visibility into changing events and a cross-product command and control core. Intelligently connect dynamic context from global threat intelligence, enterprise risk, and system security posture in real time. This interlacing of threat intelligence and risk management instantly blocks damaging attacks and enables you to adjust your security posture as risks change.

The AWS CloudFormation templates included with the Quick Start automate the following:

- Deploying the McAfee ePO Security Management Platform into a new virtual private cloud (VPC)
- Deploying the McAfee ePO Security Management Platform into an existing VPC in your AWS account

You can also use the AWS CloudFormation templates as a starting point for your own implementation.
