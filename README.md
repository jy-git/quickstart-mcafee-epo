## McAfee ePO on the AWS Cloud

This Quick Start sets up an Amazon Web Services (AWS) architecture and deploys McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator (McAfee ePO) on the AWS Cloud, using services such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC), and Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS). The Quick Start also uses AWS best practices to address common scalability, high availability, and security requirements.

McAfee ePO is a centralized, extensible platform that enables you to manage and enforce your security policies. It detects threats and helps to protect endpoints against these threats in your network.

In less than an hour, you can use a single console—the McAfee ePO console—to manage endpoint security, data loss prevention, encryption, server security in the public cloud, and the information-sharing Data Exchange Layer (DXL).

McAfee ePO enables you to handle a comprehensive threat defense lifecycle, to protect, detect, and correct from a common view across your IT environment. You can intelligently connect dynamic context from global threat intelligence, enterprise risk, and system security posture in real time. 

The AWS CloudFormation templates included with the Quick Start automate the following:

- Deploying McAfee ePO into a new virtual private cloud (VPC)
- Deploying McAfee ePO into an existing VPC in your AWS account

You can also use the AWS CloudFormation templates as a starting point for your own implementation.
